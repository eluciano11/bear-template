        For many of us on the Bear team, it’s that time of year again. Leaves
        change color and fall, winter jackets come out of hibernation, and Bear
        turns a year older! Bear is now three years old, and what a year it’s
        been.

        Quite a lot has changed since
        <a class="text-primary" href="">last November</a>. Our team has grown to
        15 people across Italy, Ireland, the UK, and the United States. Speaking
        of Ireland, our first-ever office space in
        <a class="text-primary" href="">TAG, Dublin</a> has worked out quite
        well. We love the space and Dublin as a city. A number of us work there
        regularly, while others in the region swing by often for in-person team
        time and occasional Nintendo Switch shenanigans.

      <h3 class="blog__subheader">Major updates</h3>
      <p class="blog__paragraph">
        Overall, 2019 has been a year of major projects for us. Some are already
        available, others made big strides.

        Encryption

        The ability to encrypt Bear notes has been one of the most requested
        features since our original betas on Product Hunt in 2016. It took a
        little more time to polish than we had hoped, but we wanted to get it
        right.

      <p class="blog__paragraph">
        After working with an independent security firm to solidify our code, we
        shipped Individual Note Encryption for Bear Pro users in August. It’s
        been a big hit.
