      Mirage from Evernote
    </h2>
    <p>
      To import your notes from Evernote you just need to perform a couple of
      steps:
    </p>
    <ul class="list faq__list px-4">
      <li class="mb-3">
        <span
          >Export your Evernote notes into a .enex archive following this
          <a class="text-primary" href="">export guide</a>
        </span>
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <span>Import the .enex inside Bear </span>
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <span
          >On <span class="font-semibold">macOS</span> you can import your notes
          by selecting
          <code class="faq__code">File</code>
          → <code class="faq__code">Import From</code> →
          <code class="faq__code">Evernote</code> from the menu bar.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <span
          >On <span class="font-semibold">iOS</span> you can access to the
          importers by going to
          <code class="faq__code">Import & Export</code> in the Preferences,
          locate the <code class="faq__code">Import From</code> section, select
          <code class="faq__code">Evernote</code> as format and tap on
          <code class="faq__code">Import Notes</code>.</span
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The .enex format does not include informations about your notebooks. If
      you want to keep the notebook name as a reference in Bear we suggest to
      add a tag to your notes in Evernote before exporting them. The enex does
      retain the notes you trashed in Evernote, please consider empty Evernote's
      trash before exporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before importing, it is suggested to check the
      <code class="faq__code">Exclude unintentional tags</code>
      options to avoid words which begin with # will be interpreted as Bear's
      tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to
      <a href="" class="text-primary">migrate your Evernote's notebooks</a> to
      Bear you can use tags. Create a new note in Bear with a tag for every
      notebook (e.g. <code class="faq__code">#notebook1</code>,
      <code class="faq__code">#notebook2</code>,
      <code class="faq__code">#notebook3</code>, etc…). Export each notebook in
      an enex file and import them one by one. After every import, drag and drop
      the new notes to the corresponding tag. Use the search to find the newly
      imported notes (e.g. to find the notes which do not belong to
      <code class="faq__code">#notebook1</code> and
      <code class="faq__code">#notebook2</code> search for
      <code class="faq__code">-#notebook1 -#notebook2</code>).
